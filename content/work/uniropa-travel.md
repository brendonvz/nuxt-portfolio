Working alongside Goodwell Studio, I rebuilt Uniropa Travel’s WordPress site in Elementor Pro using their new design. The project focused on improving load times, simplifying content management, and refreshing the overall visual experience.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a new Elementor Pro layout based on updated design assets
- Implemented caching and asset-minification to boost performance
- Cleaned up legacy plugins, optimized the database, and reduced server load
- Tuned images and mobile layouts for faster performance across devices
